# README

django-viewcomponent is a Django library that provides a way to create reusable components for your Django project.

It is inspired by Rails [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/).

## Why use django-viewcomponent

### Single responsibility

django-viewcomponent can help developers to build reusable components from the Django templates, and make the templates more readable and maintainable.

### Testing

django-viewcomponent components are Python objects, so they can be **easily tested** without touching Django view and Django urls.
